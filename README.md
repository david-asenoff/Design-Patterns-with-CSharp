## :eyeglasses: Repository Introduction
**Design Patterns with C#** is a repository that intends to give a basic example for Creational, Structural and Behavioral Patterns using C# console applications.
This repository is ispired by the web application named [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) of [Mr. Alexander Shvets](https://github.com/neochief).
## :pencil2: About
I. Creational - Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

 1. Factory Method - Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 2. Abstract Factory - Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 3. Builder - Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
 4. Prototype - Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
 5. Singleton - Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
    
II. Structural - Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
 1. Adapter - Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
 2. Bridge - Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
 3. Composite - Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
 4. Decorator - Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
 5. Facade - Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
 6. Flyweight - Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
 7. Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

III. Behavioral - Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
 1. Chain of Responsibility - Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
