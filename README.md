## :pencil2: About
I. Creational

 1. Abstract Factory
    - Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    
 2. Builder
    - Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
    
 3. Factory Method
    - Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 
 4. Prototype
    - Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

 5. Singleton 
    - Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
    
II. Structural

III. Behavioral
